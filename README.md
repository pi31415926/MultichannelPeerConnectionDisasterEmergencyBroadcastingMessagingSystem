# MultichannelPeerConnectionDisasterEmergencyBroadcastingMessagingSystem
My idea is to build a messaging system where people effected by natural disasters can send their requests for help and receive important information form the disaster management and command center via peer to peer connection by everyone’s smart devices. 

Even we have so many wonderful technologies, communication could still be hard to build when we are confronting natural disasters which could destroy base stations and fibers and make the internet and cellular network down. I found there could be too many issues if we don’t have good method to interact and cooperate with each other during disasters. Thus, we must use a more robust way to keep the communication, strength our community and overcome the difficulties together. In my mind, a peer connection messaging system that could pass through messages one by one to everybody is a perfect choice. These are the top three of them that could be solved by such a robust way.
1.	Solving conflicts between evacuation and rescuing
Facing natural disasters, people are panic, especially when there is no source to tell them what to do, and this may generate a lot of issues. However, if we have a platform where the disaster management and command center can send messages to guide them through the peer connection messaging system, it will save a lot of time and manpower for rescuers, which means saving more lives. For instance, it might be very tricky to coordinate the traffic for the people want to run away from a damaged area and the rescuers who want to get into. Nevertheless, we could use a map package marked with routes for evacuation and rescuers clearly and pass it through the peer connection messaging system to solve the issue.
2.	Strengthen our community to help each other nearby
During natural disasters, we might more need the help from the people nearby instead of the rescuers miles away. With the peer connection messaging system, you can send the requests for help with your location to nearby and let it pass one by one until someone is able to help you. 
3.	Getting a situation analysis quicker and more accurate
It is especially hard to do a relevant thing during disasters, statistic and analysis for calculating the amount of people effected and where they are so that we can allocate the needed resources like fresh water or tends more efficient. I am working on integrating this function into the peer connection messaging system to make it more useful.

Here, I have planned three ways to implement the peer connection messaging system between smart devices. 
1.	Wi-Fi Direct
This is a common technology on the smart phones nowadays, which allows people send messages directly from device to device via Wi-Fi. People can easily get a phone with this function and help to forward or send messages to the people nearby.
2.	Light-Fi Morse code communication with flash light plus camera and Sound-Fi Morse code communication with vibration and microphone
This is a communication way I designed to solve some special cases. For example, if a group of people are trapped on a hill by flood, we can use the Light-Fi method to communicate with them in a relatively long range.
3.	LTE-Direct
This is an emerging technology allows people to connect with each other via LTE on mobile phones in a distance. However, it is not so popular right now.
